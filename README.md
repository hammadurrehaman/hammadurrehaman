## About Me

I am a AI Engineer at AIV Studios with a strong background in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I specialize in building intelligent systems, automation tools, and AI-powered assistants with both offline and cloud-based capabilities.

I have experience across the full development cycle, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and integration in web and mobile applications. Alongside my technical work, I also run an e-commerce startup, Rangezeenat.com, which gives me practical business and product experience.
